# Project Overview:
* **This project focuses on helping developers to create popular high rated apps**
* **Used over 10,000 app samples**
* **Used exploritory data analysis to give my data an initial cleaning**
* **Explored the data by ploting barplots, violinplots, pieplots and many more**
* **Researched deeper into the dataset i.e: found the most expesive app, which are the most famous apps...**

# EDA:
**One of the most intresting parts in this project. I explored the data by applying a big variaty of plots and graphs, used regression plots to find correlation between variables. I also used pandas to clean and manipulate the data in order to gain more information and to make it more easy to extract and use. Here are some examples from my analysis advanture:**
